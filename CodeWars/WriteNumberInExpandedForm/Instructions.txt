Write Number in Expanded Form

You will be given a number and you will need to return it as a string in Expanded Form. For example:

Kata.ExpandedForm(12); # Should return "10 + 2"
Kata.ExpandedForm(42); # Should return "40 + 2"
Kata.ExpandedForm(70304); # Should return "70000 + 300 + 4"

NOTE: All numbers will be whole numbers greater than 0.
